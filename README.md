Playing_with_datum

Welcome to my learning journey! This repository is a collection of my hands-on experience working with datasets to extract insights and create meaningful visualizations. I've covered 4 scenarios that explore various aspects of data analysis, each with its own unique approach and output.

For each scenario, you'll find a separate Word document summarizing the key insights, visualizations, and analysis performed. Below are the links to each scenario's dataset:

Scenario 1: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data

Scenario 2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

Scenario 3: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harishkumardatalab/housing-price-prediction

Scenario 4: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ajay1735/customer-personality-analysis

I'm constantly learning and improving my skills, and I'm excited to share these scenarios with you. Stay tuned for more as I continue to work on new and interesting projects. I look forward to sharing a cool project with you soon!

Thank you for checking out my work, and I hope you find it insightful. Have a great day, and I’ll meet you again soon with more exciting works!
